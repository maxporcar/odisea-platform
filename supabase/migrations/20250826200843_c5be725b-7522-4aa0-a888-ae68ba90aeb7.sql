| Greet people with Bonjour or Bonsoir before asking for help. | Don''t enter shops without greeting — it''s seen as rude. |
| Always ask for student discounts on transport, cinema, museums. | Don''t assume everyone speaks English fluently. |
| Explore smaller towns and regions to see the "real France." | Don''t think Paris represents the whole country. |
| Learn some French basics — locals appreciate the effort. | Don''t be surprised by strikes or closures on Sundays. |
| Respect cultural schedules: lunch breaks, holidays, quiet evenings. | Don''t expect 24/7 shops and services like in some countries. |'
